Users can also assign chores to kids so the house is clean when parents get home from work, leading to ultimate household happiness. 

## Technology Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Express, Node JS, Firebase, Moment JS, Passport JS, Multer (used for uploading files), Cloudinary (pdf storage)

## How Users Can Get Started with Pad Notes
Users can either log in or create a new account on the main Pad Notes page. From there, they can proceed to either Join an Existing Group or Create A New Group of their own. Users will then navigate to navigation tabs for Chores, Bills, Groceries, My Tasks (all of 'your' specific user tasks) or the Chat tab for direct communication with the group.
